We created a micro-Reddit application where users can:

2. Create posts
3. Comment on different posts. Both of the same user or a different user.

We designed how to structure our model relationships and associations
We generated a new rails app from the command line.
We generated models and filled-out migrations
We ran the migrations to create tables
We added validations to the models
We created users and tested these validations in the rails console
We created our associations and added comments
